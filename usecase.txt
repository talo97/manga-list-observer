- Every manga can have multiple sites that are providing chapters.
- Each chapter can have multiple links for its viewing.

User can list all manga that are supported on the website for observing. If needed, later add pagination.
2. Add supported website
Admin can add website that is supported for manga chapters observing. Each website might need its own implementation of
